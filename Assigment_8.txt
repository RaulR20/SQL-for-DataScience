/*
1.Are the tables student_enrollment and professors directly related to each other? Why or why not?
2.Write a query that shows the student's name, the courses the student is taking and the professors that teach that course.
3.If you execute the query from the previous answer, you'll notice the student_name and the course_no is being repeated. Why is this happening?
4.In question 3 you discovered why there is repeating data. How can we eliminate this redundancy? Let's say we only care to see a single professor teaching a course
and we don't care for all the other professors that teach the particular course. Write a query that will accomplish this so that every record is distinct.
HINT: Using the DISTINCT keyword will not help. :-)
5.Why are correlated subqueries slower that non-correlated subqueries and joins?
6.In the video lectures, we've been discussing the employees table and the departments table. Considering those tables, write a query that returns employees whose 
salary is above average for their given department.
7.Write a query that returns ALL of the students as well as any courses they may or may not be taking.*/
