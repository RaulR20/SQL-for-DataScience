--QUESTIONS
/*
1.Write a query that displays only the state with the largest amount of fruit supply.

2.Write a query that returns the most expensive cost_per_unit of every season. 
The query should display 2 columns, the season and the cost_per_unit

3.Write a query that returns the state that has more than 1 import of the same fruit.

4.Write a query that returns the seasons that produce either 3 fruits or 4 fruits.

5.Write a query that takes into consideration the supply and 
cost_per_unit columns for determining the total cost and returns the most expensive state with the total cost.

6.Execute the below SQL script and answer the question that follows:
CREATE table fruits (fruit_name varchar(10));
INSERT INTO fruits VALUES ('Orange');
INSERT INTO fruits VALUES ('Apple');
INSERT INTO fruits VALUES (NULL);
INSERT INTO fruits VALUES (NULL);
Write a query that returns the count of 4. You'll need to count on the column fruit_name and not use COUNT(*)
HINT: You'll need to use an additional function inside of count to make this work.
