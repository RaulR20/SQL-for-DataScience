/* USED ASSIGMENT 4 TABLE
1. Write a query that displays 3 columns. The query should display the fruit and it's total supply along with a category of either 
LOW, ENOUGH or FULL. Low category means that the total supply of the fruit is less than 20,000. The enough category means that the 
total supply is between 20,000 and 50,000. If the total supply is greater than 50,000 then that fruit falls in the full category.

2.Taking into consideration the supply column and the cost_per_unit column, you should be able to tabulate the total cost 
to import fruits by each season. The result will look something like this:

"Winter" "10072.50"
"Summer" "19623.00"
"All Year" "22688.00"
"Spring" "29930.00"
"Fall" "29035.00"

3.Write a query that would transpose this data so that the seasons become columns and the total cost for each season fills 
the first row?*/
